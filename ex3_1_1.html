  <p>
    <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[9] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, multi-paradigm
    programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
    typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    Alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[11] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> enables
    interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[12] and major
    web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute it.
    As a multi-paradigm language, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented
    and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM,
    but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon
    the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.
